A **Code editor for Java  programming language** . The most common form of output from a Java compiler is Java class files containing platform-neutral Java bytecode, but there are also compilers that gives optimized native machine code for a particular hardware/operating system combination.

Most Java-to-bytecode compilers, likes being a well known exception, do virtually no optimization, leaving this until run time to be done by the ***JRE***

The *Java virtual machine (JVM)* loads the class files and either interprets the bytecode or just-in-time compiles it to machine code and then possibly optimizes it using dynamic compilation.

 **SETUP**
 
 1. Need of java to be installed in  required system.
 2. Import editor.java (Logic class).
 
 ***RUN***
 
 1. Either you can use IDE or CMD.
 2. clean and build.
 3. run
